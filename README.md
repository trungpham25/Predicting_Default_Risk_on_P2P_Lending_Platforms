## Overview
Analysis of 1,044,488 loan records with 114 variables from 2015 to 2018 to predict default risk using machine learning models. Developed comprehensive risk assessment framework achieving 79.6% accuracy in default prediction, enabling data-driven lending decisions and optimized risk-return portfolio management. For more information, please refer to my detailed technical paper.


## Methods & Models
- Multiple Machine Learning Approaches: OLS Regression, Logistic Regression, Ridge & Lasso Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM 
- Data Analysis: Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab


## Key Findings
- Identified strongest default predictors: loan grade, interest rate, debt-to-income ratio
- Developed risk scoring system based on FICO scores and income levels
- Created investment strategy optimizing for both returns and risk
- Generated actionable insights for P2P lending decisions
